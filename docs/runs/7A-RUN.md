# 7A-RUN — roadmap row 7a: `docs/specs/INGEST.md` v0, the Layer B / Phase 3 ingestion-mapping SPEC row

**Status:** in flight. **Row:** Phase 3's first row, opened by the founder 2026-09-02
([`docs/decisions/2026-09-02-phase3-repoint-R77-R78.md`](../decisions/2026-09-02-phase3-repoint-R77-R78.md)).
**Constraints cited by the brief:** **R58** (the façade pages under one rule for `known`; a guard never
reads a page), **R59** (tenant-blind protocol; tenancy is the host's predicate), **R60** (one three-valued
`Condition` language, the ingestion loop its first consumer), **R77** (instance resolution is Phase 3's and
`resolve_type` is never extended to cover it), **R78** (the host holds the instances — *deliberately
falsifiable, and design test 1 is what may falsify it*).
**This row ships no product code.** Its probes live under `docs/tools/`, exactly as
[`actions_nyc_probe.py`](../tools/actions_nyc_probe.py) did for row #6.
**Suite floor at the row's start:** 366 ids, sync 837 / async 874, three legs. This row must not disturb it.

Claims are tagged **[Observed] / [Inferred] / [Assumed]**.

## 0. Design test 1's expectations — **PRE-REGISTERED, written before the probe existed**

`USE-CASES.md`'s validation protocol requires expected outcomes stated *before* the walk-through. This
section is committed in its own change, ahead of [`docs/tools/ingest_seam_probe.py`](../tools/ingest_seam_probe.py),
so the pre-registration is checkable in `git log` rather than asserted in prose.

**The question, and it is R78's:** does this project become an instance store, or does it define resolution
*over instances the host already holds*? **Pass** = every outcome of `resolve_instance` is reachable with a
host-side table and a candidate-retrieval primitive, and **no instance row is copied into the registry**.
**Fail** = write why and stop; the supervisor rules before any section of `INGEST.md` is written.

### 0.1 The fixture, pinned from the real file

**[Observed] 2026-09-03**, `NH_HealthCitations_Aug2026.csv` re-downloaded from the CMS Provider Data
Catalog (`https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/r5ix-sfxw`, distribution `modified: 2026-08-01`) —
**165,336,194 bytes, 419,479 rows, 14,627 CCNs, 14,498 distinct provider names, 104 names shared by more
than one CCN.** All four numbers reproduce `USE-CASES.md`'s pre-registered figures exactly. The checked-in
400-row Montana sample carries **10** facilities and **zero** shared names, so it cannot pose this test and
the full file is used, as the brief anticipated.

| # | candidate | what the file says **[Observed]** | expected outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1.1 | `"BURNS NURSING HOME, INC."` | exactly one CCN — `015009` | **`existing`**, confidence at the top of the range |
| T1.2 | `"MILLER'S MERRY MANOR"` | **twelve** CCNs, all Indiana, all distinct facilities | **`ambiguous`** — never `existing` at 1.0, and never a proposal |
| T1.3 | a provider name absent from all 419,479 rows | no CCN | **`proposal`** |
| T1.4 | `"Provider Name"` — the column header, landed as a value | not a facility at all | **`not_an_instance`** |
| T1.5 | T1.1's candidate with the host's scan **truncated before its row** | the match exists and was not read | **the open question this test decides** — see 0.2 |

`"MILLER'S MERRY MANOR"` is the sharpest available case and it is why this fixture was chosen over the
104's alphabetical first: twelve facilities in one state answering to one string is `INTERFACE.md` §10.3's
finding at its maximum, and it is the exact shape of the kill row one level down — *two instances answering
to one identity*.

### 0.2 The one thing this test is expected to decide beyond pass/fail

The brief offers `existing` / `proposal` / `ambiguous` / `not_an_instance` — four, mirroring `resolve_type`
— and invites a different closed set to be argued. **T1.5 is the case that decides it.** R58 makes the
candidate primitive page, so a scan can end without having read the row that would have matched. Under a
four-outcome set that scan has nowhere to land but `proposal`, and a proposal is how a second row for one
facility gets created. **Predicted [Inferred]: the four-outcome set is not closed under Rule U and a fifth,
`unknowable`, is required** — with the whole point being that it is an *outcome* and not a flag, because a
flag beside `outcome="proposal"` is a caller's to ignore.

**Recorded as a prediction, not as a finding.** If T1.5 lands cleanly in one of the four, the fifth is not
taken and this paragraph is the record of a wrong guess.

### 0.3 What is asserted about the seam itself

1. The registry is the **shipped** `ontoloche.Registry` on SQLite — so *"no instance rows"* is a claim about
   the real store, not about a probe kit. After the whole walk-through, the store's type table is
   enumerated and must hold **only** `kind="entity"` vocabulary rows.
2. The host table is reached **only** through the candidate primitive. The probe holds it to
   `PACKAGE.md` §3.1's adapter boundary by source inspection, the way `C0-04` and
   `edges_probe_kit.assert_adapter_boundary()` do: the host-side object may not name a façade shape.
3. Nothing in the walk-through calls `resolve_type` on an instance string. **R77 is non-negotiable** and
   the probe asserts the separation rather than assuming it.
